# Whatapop

This is an AngularJS Products Marketplace Web app. User interface is built using Bootstrap responsive framework. It follows the Single Page Application pattern.

The application is composed by three components:

* A Main Component with a navigation bar in witch we can find a product search form. It allows us to filter products by category, distance or name.
* One page to display the products resulting from the search
* One more page to display products detail

In this app you can find samples of how to use different AngularJS elements like Services, Filters, Directives, Components, Values or Component Router on it's version 2.0 for AngularJS 1.5.
 
Sample data is provided by a development only sparring backend called node-sparrest. You can find more information about how to use it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sparrest).
